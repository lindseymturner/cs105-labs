function: fib
the problem size is the value of the parameter n, e.g., for fib(9), the problem size is 9;
the work is the number of times the function adds two numbers of the sequence, e.g., when it adds 13 and 21 to get 34, that's one addition (in addition to the work done to get the 13 and the 21 so that we can add them).

work = n - 2
