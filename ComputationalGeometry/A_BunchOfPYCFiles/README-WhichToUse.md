This folder has a bunch of ".pyc" files to let you install the
SampleAnswers files for various versions of Python you might be using.

Start Python (e.g., by typing "python3" on a command-line terminal),
and see if it says, e.g. Python 3.7 or Python 3.8 somewhere (it may
give more digits, e.g. Python 3.8.1, but we don't care about those).

Then, for whichever version you have, copy the version of the .pyc
files that end with those numbers, from this folder to the folder above,
and rename them to replace the versions there. For example, if you have
Python 3.7, you can copy CircleSamples.cpython-37.pyc, paste it into
the ComputationalGeometry project, and then rename it CircleSamples.pyc
(thereby replacing the old CircleSamples.pyc).
