This project includes "pyc" versions of the "Sample Answers" that are used to
test the test suites required by the lab. Distributing them as ".pyc" files
makes it possible for students with the same version of Python (3.8) to run the
sample answer without having, at hand, a temptation to just look at the functions.the

Thanks to https://portingguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/etc.html for stating that
Python3 pyc files can still be distributed:

    If you rely on importing .pyc files without corresponding source, you will need to
    move the .pyc to the old location, and remove the version tag.

In case you are using Python 3.7, there are alternative versions in the folder A_BunchOfPYCFILES
